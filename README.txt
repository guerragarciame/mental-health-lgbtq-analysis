This is an analysis of mental health predictors. It analyzes how physical health, emotional support, and LGBTQ+ status relate to mental health using the 2023 BRFSS data.

In order to run this project, please follow the next steps:

1. Get the data by downloading the LLCP2023.XPT file from the CDC BRFSS website (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html) and put the file in a new folder. This folder also has to include the FinalProject_M. Guerra Garcia.Rmd and the references.bib file.
2. Install R and RStudio, then install the janitor, haven, sjlabelled, tidyverse, table1, posterdown, dunn.test, and car packages.
3. Knit the poster by opening the R markdown file titled FinalProject_M. Guerra Garcia.Rmd and clicking on the "Knit" button in RStudio.
