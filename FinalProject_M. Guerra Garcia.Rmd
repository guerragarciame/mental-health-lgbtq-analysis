# Research Purpose

Do physical health, emotional support, and LGBTQ+ status help to predict mental health status?

# Data Description

-   These data were collected as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) throughout the 2023 year, which includes data from 48 states in the United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.

-   These data were collected via landline telephone and cellular telephone-based surveys. States and other locations listed above conducted telephone interviews every day during each calendar month, during both daytime and evening hours.

-   The entire data set contains 433,323 observations (participants in the survey) and 350 variables (questions or other pieces of information asked during the survey).

# Variable Measurement

Outcome:

-   **Mental Health Status** (continuous): people reported the number of days during the past 30 days when their mental health was not good (0 - 30)

Predictors

-   **Physical Health Status** (continuous): people reported the number of days during the past 30 days when their physical health was not good (0 - 30)

-   **Emotional Support** (categorical): people reported how often they get the emotional support they need - always, usually, sometimes, rarely, never

-   **LGBTQ+ Identification** (categorical): people reported whether or not they identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community - 0 (no), 1 (yes)

-   The median number of poor mental health days was 0 (IQR = 5.00).

-   The median number of poor physical health days was 0 (IQR = 4.00).

-   Among those who responded (51.5% of participants), the majority reported receiving consistent emotional support, with more than 40% reporting that they "Always" or "Usually" receive the emotional support they need.

-   Among male and female respondents, the majority were non-LGBTQ+ identifying individuals.

-   Histograms of the continuous variables (mental health and physical health) were performed; results showed that they were right-skewed, so the median was used to describe the data.

-   Figure 1 shows that higher numbers of poor physical health days are associated with higher numbers of poor mental health days. This indicates that there is a positive relationship between poor physical and mental health.
-   For people reporting no poor physical health days, the median number of poor mental health days is O (IQR = 2). For people reporting 30 poor physical health days, the median number of poor mental health is 4 (IQR = 30). Both poor mental health and physical health days have an overall median of 0.
-   The distribution of poor mental health vs. poor physical health gets sparser at higher values, indicating that severe poor mental and physical health days are experienced less commonly in the population. This is supported by the fact that the strongest relationship in this distribution is in the 0-20 day range.

```

-   A Spearman's correlation test (rho) was conducted to assess the relationship between mental health and physical health days. This is the most appropriate test since two continuous variables are being assessed, and the data is not normally distributed.
-   The assumptions for the Spearman's correlation test (rho) are that the variables being tested are at least ordinal or closer to continuous and that the relationship between the two variables is monotonic, which means that the relationship between the two variables must only go in one direction. Both physical health and mental health days are continuous variables and have a monotonic relationship (as poor physical health days increase, poor mental health days also increase).
-   Based on the Spearman's correlation test (rho) results, there is a statistically significant but moderate positive correlation between days of poor physical health and days of poor mental health (rho = 0.32, p \< 0.001). Although the correlation is moderate, this test shows that as the number of poor physical health days increases, so do the number of poor mental health days.

-   Figure 2 shows that people who receive less frequent emotional support have a tendency to report more day of poor mental health. People that "Rarely" receive emotional support report the highest median of 10 days of poor mental health (IQR = 26 days) while those who "Always" or "Usually" receive emotional support report a median of 0 days.
-   The variability in mental health seems to increase as emotional support decreases. This is shown by the increasing IQR values: Always (IQR = 0 days), Usually (IQR = 5 days), Sometimes (IQR = 15 days), and Rarely (IQR = 26 days)
-   One interesting thing to note is that people that reported that they "Never" receive emotional support show less variability (IQR = 10 days) than those that reported that they "Rarely" or "Sometimes" receive support (IQR = 26 days and IQR = 15 days), respectively. Through deeper analysis of this, I discovered that there is a split in how people in this category report their mental health. Approximately 60% of this group reports zero poor mental health days, which could suggest that these people have developed strong coping mechanisms and resilience and do not require emotional support. However, people that do report mental health problems tend to report very high numbers of poor mental health days, and this split explains why the median is lower in the "Rarely" group despite the "Never" group actually containing some of the most impacted individuals in the data set.

           center = median) 

```

-   The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to assess differences in poor mental health days across emotional support groups. This test was chosen because the outcome variable (number of poor mental health days) is continuous, but it is not normally distributed. Additionally, the poor mental health days are being compared across more than two independent groups, which are five levels of emotional support.

-   The assumptions to use the Kruskal-Wallis test were met. Some of these assumptions were described in the previous bullet point. Observations used for this data are independent as they are from different survey respondents, and the levels of emotional support are all considered independent groups. The data across all groups is right-skewed and not normally distributed. Additionally, according to Levene's test, the variances are not equal across emotional support groups (F(4, 219283) = 5880, p \< 0.001). Therefore, it was appropriate to use the Kruskal-Wallis test, rather than ANOVA, Brown-Forsythe, or Welch's tests.

-   The Kruskal-Wallis test demonstrates that there are statistically significant differences in poor mental health days across the assessed emotional support groups (H(6) = 26622, p \< 0.001).

-   The post-hoc Dunn tests with Bonferroni correction demonstrate the following:

    -   The strongest difference was found between the groups that "Always" and "Sometimes" get emotional support (z = -130.44, p\<0.001). This means that people that "Sometimes" get emotional support tend to have more days of poor mental health (median = 5 days) than people who "Always" get emotional support (median = 0 days).
    
    -   The second strongest difference was found between the groups that "Always" and "Rarely" get emotional support (z = -98.37, p\<0.001), which means that people that "Rarely" get emotional support tend to have more days of poor mental health (median = 10 days) than people who "Always" get emotional support (median = 0 days) but a higher rate than those that "Sometimes" get emotional support.
    
    -   All comparisons between the Always, Usually, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never emotional support categories were statistically significant (all p\<0.001), signifying that there is pattern where less frequency of emotional support is associated with more days of poor mental health.

-   Figure 3 shows that people that identify as LGBTQ+ tend to report higher numbers of poor mental health days compared to non-LGBTQ+ individuals.
-   LGBTQ+ individuals (n = 19,232) report a median of 4 days of poor mental health while non-LGBTQ+ (n = 254,713) individuals report a median of 0 days of poor mental health.
-   There is greater variability in the reported mental health experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals vs. non-LGBTQ+ individuals as evidenced by the fact that LGBTQ+ data have almost four times the IQR of non-LGBTQ+ individuals (15 days vs. 4 days).

-   A Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to assess the differences in poor mental health days between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ individuals. This test was selected because we are comparing two independent groups (binary categorical independent variable: LGBTQ+ status) to a continuous variable (number of poor mental health days), and the data in the continuous variable is not normally distributed.
-   As described in the previous bullet, this test was chosen due to these data comparing two independent groups with a continuous variable. The observations in this data set are independent as the observations come from individual survey respondents in the BRFSS's random telephone sampling. This test does not require normally distributed data or equal variances, so this is the most appropriate test due to the failed assumptions of the t-test and other similar tests. This data being assessed is not normally distributed, and the variances between the groups are significantly different as evidenced by Levene's test (F(1, 273943) = 4495.9, p < 0.001).
-   The results of the test show that LGBTQ+ individuals reported significantly more days of poor mental health (median = 4 days) compared to non-LGBTQ+ individuals (median = 0 days) (W = 3,239,866,360, p < 0.001). The effect size of r = 0.02 indicates that there is a small effect significance despite statistical significance.

# Summary and Recommendations

This assessment of the 2023 BRFSS data showed that physical health status, emotional support frequency, and LGBTQ+ status were all statistically significantly associated with reported days of poor mental health. Consistent with these findings, prior studies have also found significant associations between poor physical and mental health outcomes, the protective role of emotional support, and higher rates of mental health challenges among LGBTQ+ individuals [@fredriksen-goldsen2013; @gariépy2016; @frost2015].

Given the significant association between physical and mental health outcomes, healthcare systems should develop collaborative care models that integrate primary care physicians and mental health professionals to support patients. Additionally, since LGBTQ+ individuals report higher rates of poor mental health and emotional support shows a protective effect against poor mental health days, establishing targeted support programs for the LGBTQ+ community is crucial for improving mental health outcomes.
